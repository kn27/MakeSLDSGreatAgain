# MakeSLDSGreatAgain

Improve the performance of the Switching Linear Dynamic System (SLDS) model and its multipopulation extension by using a sequential autoencoder to approximate the motor cortex dynamics and generate denoised firing rates from spike data.

Code available upon request.

Preliminary result is included in the repo. Stay tuned for some exciting update soon!
